	"description": "Ravencrest Couriers\n\nThis mod aims to solve a long-standing concern for the Conan Exiles RP community: being able to write documents, and share them with other players! While the vanilla game does contain notes and journals that you can write into, the possibilities are limited:\n- You can only write one page of text\n- You can only write on them after placing them into the world\n- If you pick them up, the text is lost\n\nRavencrest Couriers offers in addition:\n- Notes that can be placed in the bases of other players\n- Scrolls that can be sealed\n- Books that may contain multiple pages\n- You can embed images in the text\n- All items can be placed down and then picked up again, while preserving their contents\n- All items can be read and written while in your inventory, e.g. a personal journal\n- Craftable bird coops where you can train birds to send your documents to others\n- Craftable mail boxes where other players can deposite items into, or send their birds to\n\nDocumentation ::: https://thraxerrrr.github.io/RavencrestCouriers/\nDiscord ::: https://discord.gg/FtWrKAZ",
